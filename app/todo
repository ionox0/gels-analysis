- works with pdfs (extracts images)
- y_min and y_max from bounding box (js)
- return densitometry graph of lanes
- normalize y_min and y_max?
- logging
- tests
- only use blue channel for y_mean?
- modularize
- mean kernel smoothing

- classification
    - train on old samples
    - how to normalize coordinates?
    - which gel format to use? how to normalize across colors + dimensions / lengths?
    - issues with lighting, blur, translation etc
